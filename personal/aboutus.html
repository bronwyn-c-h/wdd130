        <p class="para">The Barton Reading & Spelling System is a structured, Orton-Gillingham-based program designed to help individuals with dyslexia and other reading difficulties improve their literacy skills. It is a systematic, explicit, and multisensory phonics-based program that teaches spelling, reading, and writing in a step-by-step manner.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Key Features of the Barton System</h2>
        <p class="points">
            Multisensory Approach – Students learn through visual, auditory, and kinesthetic methods (hearing, seeing, and touching/moving).
            Explicit and Systematic Instruction – Concepts are broken down into small, manageable steps and taught directly.
            One-on-One Tutoring – The program is designed for tutors to work individually with students.
            Sequential and Cumulative – The system follows a structured order, ensuring that students master foundational skills before moving on.
            Focus on Phonemic Awareness – It starts by ensuring students can recognize and manipulate individual sounds (phonemes) before learning to read and spell words.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Barton System Structure</h2>
        <p class="para">The program consists of 10 levels, progressing from basic phonemic awareness to advanced reading and spelling skills.</p>
