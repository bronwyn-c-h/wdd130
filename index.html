                    <p>I am a transfer student from SUU. My major is early childhood education. But I'm open to trying new things, which is why I'm taking this class.</p>
                    <p>I love to read and play board games with my family. I love to go on roadtrips and night drives.</p>
                    <p>I think web design is a really cool skill to know, especially because everything is online now. I'm hope to be able to help my family and their small businesses with the skills I learn in this class.</p>
